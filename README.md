My first project for TOP!

For my first project, first I make a new directory for the project using the command line.

Then, I create a new repo for my project on GitHub. I clone the repository onto my computer using the "git clone (SSH link)" command in my terminal. 

I set up a README.md file in my project directory and here I am, introducing my project and describing the steps I've taken so far in creating it.

As I work on my project, I have to make meaningful commits for the changes in my project using the "git add" and "git commit" commands before pushing it to GitHub with the "git push origin main" command.
