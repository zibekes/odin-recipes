My first project for TOP!

For my first project, first I make a new directory for the project using the command line.

Then, I create a new repo for my project on GitHub. I clone the repository onto my computer using the "git clone (SSH link)" command in my terminal. 

I set up a README.md file in my project directory and here I am, introducing my project and describing the steps I've taken so far in creating it.

As I work on my project, I have to make meaningful commits for the changes in my project using the "git add" and "git commit" commands before pushing it to GitHub with the "git push origin main" command. 

As I got into my project, I realized making templates for each page to fill out would be helpful, making my project less tedious and ensuring the pages
were cohesive. I also decided to include source links to images I used and included a home page button at the bottom of my screen. This gave me a little more
opportunity to work with inserting links. 

I ran into three issues during my project. A weird one had nothing to do with the actual project itself, but VCS. I couldn't for the life of me type the number **zero, I had to copy and paste it. Another thing is linking relative images confuses me a little bit, so I have to play around with the links a bit for the photos I save before I can get it working correctly, as it doesn't match the same pathway used on the TOP lesson I learned from. And the third issue was quite minor, but I found it kind of annoying trying to keep my code neat and clean. The template helped with this but I'm not always one hundred percent (still can't type zeros lol) on when to indent, but I guess it's probably more about making the code easy to read and look at, so it's not that huge of a deal.

**Edit: I fixed the 0 thing by checking my keybinds and copy and pasting a 0 into the search bar to
see what it was bound to, and changed it! 

I finished up without any trouble, except at the end one of my headings for my feta recipe was indented and I couldn't figure out why. But then I saw that I accidentally deleted the closing line for one of my list elements and once I added that the issue was solved. So that's cool. 

I was debating whether or not to include the weed joke in my cereal recipe in case I end up using this in my portfolio one day, but I figured that if my future prospective recruiter or hiring person was anti weed jokes, then maybe our work relationship isn't meant to be. I am full sending on the weed joke. Humor is important in this world.

Alright, the html side of this is done. That's a wrap, folks-- until I apply some CSS knowledge to it.
