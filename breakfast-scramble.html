    <h1>Breakfast Scramble Recipe</h1>
    <p>Everyone loves a simple breakfast! My girlfriend made this for me a few months ago, and ever since, I eat it nearly everyday. 
        It is super simple, super fast, and super yummy. You can definitely throw in more seasonings or veggies if you want to spruce up this dish,
        or you can keep it nice and easy like me. Either way it's good as fuck.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup Jasmine rice (uncooked)</li>
        <li>4  Amylu chicken sausage links</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Preferred amount of Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Preferred amount of Sriracha </li>
     </ul>
 
    <h2>How It's Made</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the jasmine rice. If you don't know how, <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-cook-jasmine-rice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here's how you do that.</a></li>
        <li>Slice the sausage into small pieces, and brown them off in the skillet on medium heat.</li>
